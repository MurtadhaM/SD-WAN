In Research Methodology, we will be discussing the process of how we will be implementing our SD-WAN Lab. We will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a physical lab, and the advantages and disadvantages of a virtual lab. We will also be discussing the equipment that we will be using in our physical lab, and the topology of our physical lab. We will also be discussing the goal typology of our physical lab.
