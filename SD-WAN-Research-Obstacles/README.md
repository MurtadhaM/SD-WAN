### Introduction
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Introduction-SD--WAN-blue)

Because of its capacity to route across several provider networks and give network visibility, SD-WAN is a formidable alternative to existing WAN solutions. It might be the solution to your networking prayers, but appropriate SD-WAN design and deployment is subtle and sophisticated. This is why we are here to help you understand the technology and how to implement it in your network.

### Problem Statement 
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Problems-List-red)

``SD-WAN is not a well known technology in the research community because of the lack of resources and the high cost of implementation.``


- **SD-WAN**: Cost of Implementation
- **SD-WAN**: High Skill Requirements for Implementation
- **SD-WAN**: Lack of Resources for Research and Development


### Problem Description
- SD-WAN implementation skill barrier is high.

   
   To benefit from SD-WAN, the researcher must have a good understanding of the technology and how to implement it as well as having access to enterprise-grade equipment from vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, and others.

- [ ] WAN Links are expensive and having multiple links is a costly solution for researchers.

    To test SD-WAN, the researcher must have multiple WAN links to test the failover and load balancing features of SD-WAN. This is not a feasible solution for researchers because of the high cost of WAN links.

### Solution
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Solution-List-green)

- [ ] Sandbox environment for SD-WAN.

    Vendors such as Cisco and Fortinet provide a sandbox environment for researchers to test their products. However, the sandbox environment is limited to a few hours of testing and the researcher must have a good understanding of the technology to be able to test it in the sandbox environment. The way to solve this problem is to create a sandbox environment for SD-WAN that is accessible to researchers and students to test their SD-WAN solutions.

### Conclusion
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conclusion-SD--WAN%20is%20the%20future-yellowgreen)

SD-WAN is the future of networking and it is a technology that is worth researching and implementing. However, the lack of resources and the high cost of implementation is a barrier for researchers and students to learn and implement SD-WAN. This is why we are here to help you understand the technology and how to implement it in your network.
